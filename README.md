## Assignment 2

Visualizing the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains information on 768 women who are at least 21 years old from a population residing around Arizona, USA.

The reason why is it focused on this group was because this group was deemed to have a high incidence rate of diabetes mellitus. By the 1970s, the occurence of type-2 diabetes was about forty percent among Pimas age thirty-five and older.


In total, there are **9** columns:
| Variable name        | Description           |
| ------------- |:------------- |
| Pregnancies | Number of times pregnant |
| Glucose | Plasma glucose concentration at 2 Hours in an oral glucose tolerance test or GTIT (Mg/DL) |
| BloodPressure | Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) |
| SkinThickness | Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) |
| Insulin | 2-Hour serum insulin level (Î¼IU/mL) |
| BMI | Body mass index |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes likelihood depending on age and family history |
| Age | Age in years |
| Outcome | 1 (diabetes) or 0 (non-diabetes) |
